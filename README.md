# Spotify_data_extraction
The purpose of this project was to gauge the emotional state of the country using music. I choose to use Spotify because it is one of the most popular music streaming platforms in the USA. Having knowledge on the most popular songs among a given population is very important to understanding what emotions people gravitate towards when it comes to music.
