It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's 10 o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep tellin' me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby, now and then

Don't you just wanna wake up
Dark as a lake
Smellin' like a bonfire
Lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe
I think it's great
But while in this world

For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

Stick Season,Noah Kahan,84,['pov: indie'],"54 ContributorsTranslationsالعربيةEspañolDeutschFrançaisNorsk (bokmål / riksmål)Stick Season Lyrics[Verse 1]
As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes

[Chorus]
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

[Verse 2]
So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me ""forever,"" now you still can't call me back

We had a plan, move out of this town, baby
West to the sand, it's all we talked about lately
I'd pack the car, bring your guitar and jane for smokin'
First thing at dawn, you'd queue the songs and we'd get goin'
But you weren't home, waited on the porch for ya
Sat there alone, all throughout the morn' 'til I
Got a hunch down in my gut and snuck around the back
Empty cans and I'll be damned, your shit was never packed

[Chorus]
Did your boots stop workin'? Did your truck break down? (Truck break down)
Did you burn through money? Did your ex find out? (Ex find out)
Where there's a will, then there's a way, and I'm damn sure you lost it
Didn't even say goodbye, just wish I knew what caused it
Was the whiskey flowin'? Were you in a fight? (In a fight)
Did the nerves come get you? What's your alibi? (Alibi)
I made my way back to LA, and that's where you'll be forgotten
In forty years, you'll still be here, drunk washed up in Austin

[Verse 2]
Hell of a bluff, you had me believin'
How many months did you plan on leavin'?
What happened? Bad habits?
Did you go back? Go batshit?
I loved you, how tragic, oh-oh

Did your boots stop workin'? Did your truck break down? (Truck break down)
Did you burn through money? Did your ex find out? (Ex find out)
Where there's a will, then there's a way, and I'm damn sure you lost it
Didn't even say goodbye, just wish I knew what caused it
Was the whiskey flowin'? Were you in a fight? (In a fight)
Did the nerves come get you? What's your alibi? (Alibi)
I made my way back to LA, and that's where you'll be forgotten
In forty years, you'll still be here, drunk washed up in Austin
